            <h3>Brief Background of Joseph’s Life</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Joseph Shanahan was born in Currafrusha, Glankeen, Borrisoleigh,
                Co. Tipperary, Ireland, on 4 June 1871. He was baptised by
                Father P.J. Morris on 7 June in Borrisoleigh parish Church. His
                parents were Daniel Shanahan and Margaret Walsh. Daniel and
                Margaret were married in Templederry on 17 June 1864. Father
                John Kenyon P.P. officiated at the ceremony. Their first child
                Mary was born in 1865 and some time after Mary’s birth the
                family moved to Glankeen in the neighbouring parish of
                Borrisoleigh. The next three Shanahan children were born in
                Glankeen – Joseph in 1871. Some two or three years after
                Joseph’s birth his father was offered the job as herdsman by
                John Dwyer O’Ryan near his own residence in Cloghonan,
                Templederry and the family moved back to the Templederry, six
                miles south east of Nenagh.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Shanahan family lived in a two-storey house in Gortnalaura
                adjacent to the Church and primary school. Joseph first attended
                primary school at Clohinch quite close to his home and beside
                the parish church. This National School at Clohinch was opened
                in 1862. Prior to this there had been another National School
                already in existence in the parish since 1845. This school was
                located about a mile and a half from Templederry and the stone
                plaque still extant reads ‘Templederry National School’. From
                December 1884 Joseph Shanahan attended the older school in
                Gortnagoona with his brother Dick. Joseph remained on at
                Gortnagoona School until 31 July 1886 until he finished 6th
                class and was by then 15 years old.

            <h3>Studies in France</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                In 1886 Joseph went to France to study for the priesthood. The
                Congregation of the Holy Spirit (Spiritan Fathers) was entrusted
                with the running of an Apostolic School in Beauvais. Joseph had
                an uncle in this Congregation – Brother Adelm – who in 1886 was
                appointed to the school in Beauvais. When Father Limbour, who
                was in charge of the school, learned from Br. Adelm that he had
                a nephew who was interested in becoming a priest in the Spiritan
                Congregation but had not the financial resources required in
                Ireland, he agreed to take Joseph into the school in Beauvais.
              </p>
              <p>
                Joseph was to remain eleven years in France, from 1886-1897,
                without returning to Ireland. He was awarded his BSc, studied
                his Philosophy, completed his novitiate and in 1897 returned to
                Rockwell College in Ireland as ‘Prefect’ or Junior Master. This
                college is run by the Spiritan Fathers. He was an outstanding
                rugby player in Munster club competitions.

            <h3>Ordination in Nigeria</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                On 22 April 1900 Joseph Shanahan was ordained a priest in
                Blackrock College and served as Dean of the boarding school in
                Rockwell. In 1902 he was appointed to the Mission of Southern
                Nigeria and left Ireland on the 9 October of that year on his
                first missionary journey. On the 27 September 1905 Fr. Shanahan
                was appointed as Prefect Apostolic of Lower Niger. On 6 June
                1920 he was ordained Bishop of Southern Nigeria at Maynooth
                College, Ireland.

            <h3>Founder of the Missionary Sisters of the Holy Rosary</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                On 7 March 1924 Bishop Joseph Shanahan founded the Missionary
                Sisters of the Holy Rosary. He accompanied seven brave women who
                shared his vision, to a house in Killeshandra, Co. Cavan,
                Ireland. Here they were to begin religious life under the
                guidance of Dominican Sisters from Cabra, Dublin. From virtually
                nothing, this dedicated group were to form a congregation of
                Sisters who would help Bishop Shanahan in his mission,
                especially to the women of Southern Nigeria. Today Missionary
                Sisters of the Holy Rosary are international in composition and
                found in diverse cultures throughout the world. They continue in
                fidelity to their charism and the ideals of their founder, to
                seek new and untried ways in which to find and nurture the seed
                that is Christ in every culture.

            <h3>Retirement and Death</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                In 1932 Bishop Shanahan retired from the Mission of Southern
                Nigeria after 30 years of missionary endeavour. He retired to
                Blackrock College in Dublin from where he continued to work
                actively in promoting the foreign missions. In 1938, at the
                invitation of Bishop Heffernan, he went to serve in Kenya where
                he died in Nairobi on Christmas morning 1943 and was buried in
                St. Austin’s cemetery. In 1956 the Bishop’s remains were
                transferred to Nigeria and reverently placed in their final
                resting place inside the Cathedral in Onitsha that he himself
                had consecrated twenty – one years before.

            <h3>Cause of Canonisation</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Bishop Shanahan's successor in Onitsha, Archbishop Charles
                Heerey, C.S.Sp. said that while " he did not want to anticipate
                the pronouncements of the Church by calling Bishop Shanahan a
                saint, that is what he was: we fondly hope that some day
                Shanahan’s cause may be introduced, and that it may be in God’s
                Providence we may have the happiness of praying to him as one of
                the heavenly patrons of Nigeria, and of all missions and
                Missionaries."
              </p>
              <p>
                Always regarded as a saint, Bishop Shanahan’s cause for
                Canonisation was officially opened in the Archdiocese of
                Onitsha, Nigeria on 15 November 1997. The Diocesan Inquiry into
                the life and heroic virtue of Bishop Shanahan continues in the
                Archdiocese of Onitsha, Nigeria, and the Archdiocese of Dublin,
                Ireland where it was officially opened in 1998.

              <p>
                Many Witnesses in Nigeria, Ireland and other countries, though
                advanced in years, remembered Bishop Shanahan and were willing
                to testify to his life and dedicated work before the Diocesan
                Inquiries in Nigeria and Dublin. These first-hand witnesses were
                able to give facts and events in the life of the Servant of God,
                Joseph Shanahan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bishop Shanahan was a prolific letter writer. Part of the
                Diocesan Inquiry into the life and heroic virtue of this Servant
                of God is the setting up of a Commission of Experts by the
                Archbishop. This Commission gathers each and every historical
                document, either hand written or printed, which in any way
                pertains to the Cause. The exhaustive search of archives and
                libraries for documents which relate to Bishop Shanahan demands
                the expertise of those particularly trained in such fields of
                investigation. These experts are in the process of gathering all
                the written sources pertaining to Bishop Shanahan and situating
                him in the religious, social and cultural environment in which
                he is considered to have lived heroically the Christian virtues.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the members of the Commission have completed their task
                they will submit a report to the competent church authorities
                together with a report on the writings of Bishop Shanahan. This
                report, together with the testimonies of all the Witnesses will
                be forwarded to the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints in
                Rome. It is then for the Roman Congregation to determine what
                further progress can be made in examining the Cause.
